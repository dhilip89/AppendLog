# AppendLog

This library provides an efficient, asynchronous, append-only log abstraction,
which is most often found in distributed consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft,
and more recently in event sourcing.

The log contents are completely opaque as it exposes a streaming API for atomically
writing to the log:

    /// <summary>
    /// Interface for an atomic, durable transaction log.
    /// </summary>
    public interface IAppendLog : IDisposable
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The first transaction.
        /// </summary>
        TransactionId First { get;  }

        /// <summary>
        /// Atomically append data to the durable store.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>A stream for writing.</returns>
        Stream Append(out TransactionId tx);

        /// <summary>
        /// Enumerate the sequence of transactions since <paramref name="lastEvent"/>.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="lastEvent">The last event seen.</param>
        /// <returns>An enumerator over the transactions that occurred since the given event.</returns>
        IEventEnumerator Replay(TransactionId lastEvent);
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// An event enumerator.
    /// </summary>
    public interface IEventEnumerator : IDisposable
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The current transaction.
        /// </summary>
        TransactionId Transaction { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// The stream containing the current event.
        /// </summary>
        Stream Stream { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Asynchronously advance the enumerator to the next event.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns></returns>
        Task<bool> MoveNext();
    }

Writing to the log involves simply calling `Append()`, which returns
a bounded stream to which you can write. When you dispose the stream,
the log is updated atomically with the new data. Only a single writer
can call Append() at any given time, and this exclusion works across
processes too.

You can utilize any serialization API that uses the standard .NET
System.IO.Stream abstractions to write to the output stream, so the
actual content of the event log is entirely domain-specific. You
could use JSON, XML, BinaryFormatter, or some mix of all of the above
if you really wanted to.

Each TransactionId is a marker for the beginning of an `Append()`
event, which can be later used to replay the log's events.
`TransactionId.First` defines the log's first transaction.

The replay API provides a simple and efficient interface for reading
log contents from a given marker. This is often used for log
replication in distributed consensus, and for building caches in
event sourcing.

# Status

I believe the API to be complete and sufficient, but more testing is
needed. The file format is still in flux until an official release.

# Future Work

I considered a memory-mapped implementation, but locking semantics
across processes weren't clear, and the benchmarks I'd seen didn't
convey much benefit to memory mapped files for this purpose.

Streams are also quite ubiquitous, particularly for de/serialization
APIs, so this approach was just a natural fit.
