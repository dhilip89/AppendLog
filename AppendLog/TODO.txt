= TODO =

 * add IAppendLog implementation for SQL backend
 * add remote IAppendLog implementation
 * add replicated IAppendLog implementation using Raft

= MAYBE =

 * file rollover for compaction purposes, ie. can delete old entries by starting to
   write to a different file than the one we're reading from, initialized with a new base offset. We
   can then either copy the entries starting at the new base into the new file, or change the read
   logic to also open the new file when it's done with the read file. The latter is preferable.
 * creating FileStreams is expensive, so perhaps have a BoundedStream pool for readers
 * use 128 bit transaction ids, and store the "base" offset at the beginning of the db file --
   dovetails with file rollover feature
